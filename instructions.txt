Included are 2 files
logdata.csv - a csv file that contains timestamped messages indicated by message_id
periods.csv - a csv file that identifies the expected period of a given message_id

The goal of this exercise is to gain insight into the jitter present in each message in this log.
In other words, we want to know how often a message is sent 'on time' according to the expected period.
Use whatever tools you wish to dig into this data and let us know what you discover.
There is no "right answer", we're looking for critical thinking and innovation.
How far you want to take this is up to you. Please share any code you write in your efforts.
Visuals are generally helpful too.
